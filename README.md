Azure Storage Webpack Plugin
===================

This is a [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) plugin that allows you upload generated assets to an Azure storage account.
This uses the [azure-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-storage) plugin to authenticate and upload to Azure.

Maintainer: Yohan Belval [@yohanb](https://github.com/yohanb)

Installation
------------
Install the plugin with npm:
```shell
$ npm install azure-storage-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

Basic Usage
-----------

```javascript
var AzureStorageWebpackPlugin = require('azure-storage-webpack-plugin');

var webpackConfig = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: 'dist',
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new AzureStorageWebpackPlugin({
      overwrite: false,
      blobService: ['storageaccountname', 'key'],
      container: { name: 'containername', options: { publicAccessLevel: 'blob' }},

      // Optionally set cache control and content type header
      metadata: {
        cacheControl: 'public, max-age=31536000, s-maxage=31536000',
        contentType: 'application/javascript'
      }
    })
  ]
};
```

This will upload the `dist/bundle.js` file to the specified container.
Files contained in folders will also be uploaded following the respective folder structure.

**NOTE:** This plugin is not intented to be used when in a _hot-reloading_ Webpack setup.
